Extract a summary, themes, sub-themes, and narratives from the following document text. The goal is to surface themes that affect investment decisions and can be tracked as narratives evolve over time.

Coverage and richness (important)
- For long or detailed documents, extract full breadth: multiple sub-themes and multiple narratives so that the output reflects the document's content. Do not collapse or over-summarize.
- Each distinct claim or angle that affects investment decisions should appear as its own narrative with supporting evidence. 
- Use multiple themes when the document discusses several distinct investable topics or theses. When the document presents one thesis or theme with multiple entities as examples or picks (e.g. "AI risk-proof long ideas" with eight stocks), use one theme for the thesis and treat entities as sub-themes or narrative context—do not force one theme per entity in that case.
- Documents that list multiple distinct debates, key questions, or sector sections (e.g. "Big Debates", "Key Investor Debates", "Outlook by sector"): treat each major debate or section as its own theme so that all are represented. Do not collapse the whole document into a single theme; extract one theme per debate/section (e.g. "Freight / AI in transports", "Gaming & Lodging / Agentic AI", "Critical minerals", "Airlines / LCC model") so the full breadth is captured.

Summary
- Write a concise 2-4 sentence summary of the document's key investment takeaways. Focus on the most important findings, data points, or conclusions an investor should know. This summary is displayed as "Key Takeaways" on the document page, so make it punchy and actionable. Always provide a non-empty summary string.

Definitions

Theme
- The highest-level investable or analytical bucket: an entity, company, sector, or market anchor that is stable over 12–24 months.
- The theme label must be ONLY the core entity or topic name—short and canonical. NEVER append qualifiers, aspects, strategies, or dimensions to the theme label. Those belong in sub-themes.
- Examples of GOOD theme labels: "BYD", "Miniso", "HBM / AI memory", "US IPO market", "China consumer", "Gold", "TSMC", "Netflix".
- Examples of BAD theme labels (DO NOT do this):
  - "BYD International sales" → should be theme "BYD", sub_theme "International sales"
  - "Miniso growth strategy" → should be theme "Miniso", sub_theme "Growth strategy"
  - "Tesla margins pressure" → should be theme "Tesla", sub_theme "Margins"
  - "Gold safe-haven demand" → should be theme "Gold", sub_theme "Demand outlook"
  - "NVIDIA AI revenue" → should be theme "NVIDIA", sub_theme "AI revenue"
- One theme can have many narratives underneath it; do not split the same topic into multiple themes by appending sub-topics to the label.

Theme rules
- Primary focus: identify the main subject(s) that occupy a meaningful share of the text (e.g. >30%).
- Deduplication: if a topic is a subset of another (e.g. "LLMs" vs "AI"), collapse to the higher-level canonical theme unless the document is exclusively about the subset.
- No meta-themes: never use "Stock Market" or "Macro Trends"; use specific drivers (e.g. "S&P 500 Earnings", "US Treasury Yields").
- Use one theme when the document is clearly single-topic; use multiple themes when it discusses several distinct investable topics or theses.
- Entity test: if the document is primarily about a single company, fund, or asset, the theme label must be just that entity's name (e.g. "BYD", not "BYD expansion" or "BYD international sales").
- Overarching theme vs example entities: If the document is structured as one investable theme or thesis with multiple entities or names as examples or picks (e.g. "our selection of AI risk-proof long ideas" with eight stocks), use ONE theme whose label is the thematic concept (e.g. "AI risk-proof / AI displacement resilience", "Quality compounders", "European SMID value"), not one theme per entity. Put each example entity or pick as a sub_theme (e.g. "Asmodee", "Bunzl") or weave the entity name into the narrative text, so the theme remains trackable when another source later publishes different names under the same concept.
- Use multiple themes (one per entity) only when the document is genuinely multi-topic—e.g. separate deep dives on unrelated companies—not when it is a single thematic list or "picks under one idea".

Sub-theme
- A short label (2–5 words) for the specific dimension, angle, catalyst, or named entity being analyzed within the theme. Sub-themes carry the specificity—they are the place for qualifiers like "international sales", "growth strategy", "margin pressure", etc.
- Sub-themes fall into two categories:
  1. Reusable analytical lenses — standard dimensions that recur across documents. 
  2. Named catalysts or entities — specific legislation, regulations, products, technologies, partnerships, or events that are central to the narrative and likely to recur in future documents. These are trackable proper nouns or named items.
     - Examples: "GENIUS Act", "CHIPS Act", "GPT-5", "Model Y refresh", "Starlink", "Basel III endgame", "OPEC+ cuts".
     - Use these when the named entity IS the key driver of the narrative and a generic lens like "Regulation" or "Policy impact" would lose important specificity.
  3. Company or sector that are poised to benefit or negatively impacted. 
- Rule: sub-themes must be trackable across future documents — either as a reusable lens or as a named entity/catalyst that will appear in future coverage. If a sub-theme is too ephemeral or one-off, put that content in the narrative text instead.
- When in doubt, prefer the more specific sub-theme. "GENIUS Act" is better than "Regulation" if the narrative is specifically about that act.

Narrative
- The claim or change observed through the sub-theme lens—what changed, emerged, or shifted. Must be time-variant (could be false in weeks or months).
- Evidence (quotes): For each narrative, the "evidence" array must contain direct quotes or key sentences from the document when available. Use exact wording from the text; Aim for sentences or short passage that supports the narrative with key data, details, examples, elaboration.
- Lens vs claim: Sub-theme = the lens or catalyst (what aspect or what driver). Narrative = the claim or change through that lens.
  - Bad: sub_theme "high demand", narrative "Demand remains high".
  - Good: sub_theme "Demand outlook", narrative "HBM demand is outpacing supply due to AI accelerators adopting higher memory density per chip."
  - Bad: theme "BYD International sales" (theme has qualifier that belongs in sub-theme).
  - Good: theme "BYD", sub_theme "International sales", narrative "BYD is rapidly expanding into Southeast Asia and Europe…"
  - Good: theme "Stablecoins", sub_theme "GENIUS Act", narrative "The GENIUS Act is likely to establish stablecoins as the primary payment method on the internet, enhancing their utility beyond crypto transactions."
  - Bad: theme "Stablecoins", sub_theme "Regulation", narrative "The GENIUS Act is likely to establish stablecoins as…" (too generic — the specific legislation matters for tracking).
- For each narrative you must provide:
  - narrative_stance: "bullish" | "bearish" | "mixed" | "neutral" (so contradictions under the same theme/sub-theme are explicit).
  - confidence_level: "fact" | "opinion" (fact = based on reported data; opinion = based on analyst view, sentiment, or price movements; ratings of outperform/underperform by analysts and price rising/falling are opinions).

Output valid JSON only per the schema below. No markdown. The schema allows multiple items in "evidence" per narrative—use that to include several quotes per narrative.
